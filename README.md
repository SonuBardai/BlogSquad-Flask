# BlogSquad-Flask
A modular full-stack blog application made with Python Flask and a SQLite database. 

Includes options to set up Forgot-password and Verify-email address features. 
To test these features, the emails sent to the user are also displayed within the application. 

The "About" page acts as an Unverify email address end-point, for testing purposes.
